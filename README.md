Naval Robocode
===================
*Build the best - sink the rest!*

Naval Robocode is a Naval version of Robocode, where the goal is to develop a battleship to battle against other battleships in Java. The ship battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

Naval Robocode now has missiles! More power, more damage, more risk! Use with caution, creates blast radius which can hit yourself!

*Blockly*

Robocode is a game where you have to know how to program(atleast a little bit).
We wanted to make Robocode more suitable for people who don't!
So we created a visual programming interface which allows you to drag blocks instead of type code.
This was done with Google Blockly.
We also attached a little server to it which compiles and imports the ship into Naval Robocode for you!
For more information on how to set up and run the server, read the README.txt in the Robocode_install folder.


*Note*: Blockly has only been implemented for Naval Robocode so far. If there is alot of interest to make it work for normal Robocode aswell,
I am willing to create another version.

Enjoy!
